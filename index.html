				<div id="about">
					<p>With a famous NHL player for a stepbrother, Violet Hall is well acquainted with the playboy reputation of many a
						hockey star. So of course she isn’t i nterested in legendary team captain Alex Waters or his pretty, beat-up face
						and
						rock-hard six-pack abs. When Alex inadvertently obliterates Violet’s misapprehension regarding the inferior
						intellect of hockey players, he becomes much more than just a hot body with the face to match.</p>
			
					<p>Suffering from a complete lapse in judgment, Violet discovers just how good Alex is with the hockey stick in his
						pants. Violet believes her night of orgasmic magic with Alex is just that: one night. But Alex starts to call. And
						text. And email and send extravagant—and quirky—gifts. Suddenly, he’s too difficult to ignore, and nearly
						impossible
						not to like.</p>
			
					<p>The problem is, the media portrays Alex as a total player, and Violet doesn’t want to be part of the game.</p>
